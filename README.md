This project aims at providing a Galaxy-like client for GOG with the help of https://www.gog.com/forum/general/unofficial_gog_api_documentation/page1 also for Linux systems.

## Dependencies
You need .NET Core 2.1 to run Andromeda. You can download it here:
https://www.microsoft.com/net/download

## Installation
Just download the `.tar.xz`, `.tar.gz` or `.zip` file from the GitHub releases and unpack it anywhere you want.

## Usage
Execute `start.sh` or `start.cmd` (untested) to run the program. You can type `help` to see, what you can do.

## Development
### Building
(The build scripts are just for linux. You have to build this on other platforms manually)
To build this project, you can run build.sh. This will restore the whole solution (`dotnet restore`) and build the consoleapp using fake (`cd Andromeda.ConsoleApp && dotnet fake build`).
The script will automatically start the build, you can comment the line out to avoid this.

To start the program use dotnet and the build .dll: `dotnet ./bin/Debug/netcoreapp2.1/Andromeda.ConsoleApp.dll` or `dotnet ./Andromeda.ConsoleApp/bin/Debug/netcoreapp2.1/Andromeda.ConsoleApp.dll` depending on your location

### Versioning
I will try to stick to Semantic Versioning 2.0.0 (http://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

### Used Tools
I write the code in "Visual Studio Code" (https://code.visualstudio.com/).
