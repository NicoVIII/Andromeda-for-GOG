This project aims at providing a Galaxy-like client for GOG with the help of https://www.gog.com/forum/general/unofficial_gog_api_documentation/page1 also for Linux systems. It will focus the downloading, installing and updating of games at first.  
If you need something to play Multiplayer over Galaxy on linux, have a look at the comet project from the brilliant guy who started the unofficial documentation:

## Dependencies

### Setup (VSCode)
TBD

To build the program use dotnet: `dotnet build`

To start the program use dotnet and the build `.dll`:  
`dotnet ./bin/Debug/netcoreapp2.1/Andromeda.AvaloniaApp.dll` or `dotnet ./Andromeda.AvaloniaApp/bin/Debug/netcoreapp2.1/Andromeda.AvaloniaApp.dll` depending on your location

### Versioning
I will try to stick to Semantic Versioning 2.0.0 (http://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

### Used Tools
I write the code in "Visual Studio Code" (https://code.visualstudio.com/).
